    Given some input parameters, return the full parallel solution.

    The function `heat_parallel()` is meant to be executed by each individual
    process. This function takes in some problem parameters and an MPI
    Communicator and has Process 0 return the full-domain solution by piecing
    together the components computed in parallel.

    The initial condition, u0, of the example is:

        u0 = 1,  for the first N/comm.size elements
        u0 = 0,  elsewhere

    Parameters
    ----------
    dx : double
        The space step size.
    N : int
        The number of space points to use in the full domain.
    dt : double

        numerical results will be unstable.
    Nt : int
        The number of time steps to take.
